## 🌟 About This Project

This project is a bus route finder and journey planner for Mangalore city. It is built around the real bus route data in [public/data/bus-data.csv](public/data/bus-data.csv), which the app loads and parses on the server to power route search, route browsing, and correction workflows.

The main experience is the home page route finder: you enter a source stop and a destination stop, and the app searches the route network for direct trips or journeys with transfers using a deterministic graph traversal algorithm. The results are then presented with the exact buses, stops, and transfer points so a user can actually follow the trip.

Beyond route search, the project includes a full browse-and-manage flow:

- The [All Routes](src/app/routes/page.tsx) page lets you search the complete route list by bus number, description, or stop name.
- The [Saved Journeys](src/app/saved/page.tsx) page stores favorite routes in the browser so they can be reopened later on the same device.
- The [Settings](src/app/settings/page.tsx) page handles theme switching and route feedback.
- The correction form submits proposed CSV updates through a GitHub-backed pull request flow, so route data can be edited, added, or removed without changing the app manually.

This was built as part of my **Google Developer Groups (GDG) Lead application** to show a practical product, not a demo shell: a real data source, a local routing engine, responsive UI, saved state, and a contribution path for keeping the route database current.
